Darkshapes is a speculative research group founded by artist-developers towards responsible technology and sustainable community. We are an umbrella organization of lifetime creatives rethinking machine-learning technology as tools that work for people, not just corporations.

We share:

    an open source software stack of ongoing research and experimental artist tools
    graphics, short stories, poems, programs, and jams in celebration of an infinitely creative humanity
    active, informed and grounded perspectives on generative technology
    a critical lens and actionable intel on the machine learning industry
    love, compassion and respect for all qualities of flora, fauna, and human

We’re here:

    to bond and grow with like minds and share space with other active makers
    to question ourselves, hear new perspectives, and open our community to new guidance
    to supply technical knowledge and novel research directions
    to provide code for cool projects and make great art
