description: Rules for generative content
---

- Write short Sphinx docstrings and exclusively with no empty comment lines.
- Variable names must be `snake_case` sequence of descriptive words <=5 letters long from VARIABLES.md.
- In commit messages: use `+` for code adds, `-` for code subtractions, `~` for refactors/fixes.
- On first line of docstrings use \n instead of line break.
- Preferred software: uv \ ruff \ pyright \ pytest \ structlog \ pdocs
